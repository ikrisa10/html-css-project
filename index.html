            <p>
              In this 1980s sci-fi classic, small-town California teen Marty
              McFly (Michael J. Fox) is thrown back into the '50s when an
              experiment by his eccentric scientist friend Doc Brown
              (Christopher Lloyd) goes awry. Traveling through time in a
              modified DeLorean car, Marty encounters young versions of his
              parents (Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson), and must make sure that
              they fall in love or he'll cease to exist. Even more dauntingly,
              Marty has to return to his own time and save the life of Doc
              Brown.

              In 1985, <a href="#Marty">Marty McFly</a> is a typical teenager
              living in Hill Valley, California. At home, Marty's cowardly
              father George is bullied by his supervisor,
              <a href="#Biff">Biff Tannen</a>. His mother Lorraine is an
              overweight, depressed alcoholic, and his older siblings are
              professional and social failures. At school, Marty is criticized
              for repeated tardiness and fails an audition for the Battle of the
              Bands. He confides in his girlfriend Jennifer Parker about fears
              of becoming like his parents, despite his ambitions.
            </p>
            <p>
              That night, Marty meets his eccentric scientist friend
              <a href="#Doc">Emmett "Doc" Brown</a> in the Twin Pines mall
              parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified
              DeLorean, powered by plutonium he swindled from Libyan terrorists.
              Doc inputs a destination time of November 5, 1955 – the day he
              first conceived his time travel invention. The terrorists arrive
              unexpectedly, opening fire and shooting Doc. Marty flees in the
              DeLorean, inadvertently activating time travel when he reaches 88
              miles per hour (142 km/h).
            </p>
            <p>
              Arriving in 1955, Marty discovers that he has no plutonium to
              return. While exploring a burgeoning Hill Valley, Marty encounters
              his teenage father and discovers that Biff has been bullying him
              since high school. George falls from a tree while spying on the
              teenage Lorraine. Marty is struck by a car while saving George and
              knocked unconscious. He wakes to find himself tended to by
              Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marty tracks down a younger Doc and convinces him he is from the
              future. Doc explains the only source capable of generating the
              required 1.21 gigawatts of power for time travel is a lightning
              bolt. Marty shows Doc a fundraising flyer from the future that
              documents an upcoming lightning strike at the town's courthouse.
              Marty's siblings begin to fade from a photo he is carrying with
              him. He and Doc realize that Marty's actions are altering the
              future and jeopardizing their chances to exist; Lorraine was
              supposed to meet George instead of Marty after the car accident.
              Early attempts to get his parents acquainted fail, and Lorraine's
              infatuation with Marty deepens.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance. He plots to feign
              inappropriate advances on Lorraine, allowing George to intervene
              and "rescue" her. The plan goes awry when Biff's gang interrupts
              and locks Marty in the trunk of the performing band's car, while
              Biff forces himself onto Lorraine. George arrives expecting to
              find Marty, and Biff bullies him into submission. After Biff hurts
              Lorraine, an enraged George knocks him unconscious. He escorts a
              grateful Lorraine to the dance. The band frees Marty from their
              car, but the lead guitarist is injured in the process. Marty takes
              his place and performs while George and Lorraine share their first
              kiss. With his future no longer in jeopardy, Marty heads to the
              courthouse to meet Doc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before the dance, Marty concealed a handwritten note in Doc's
              coat, warning him about his future. As the storm arrives, Doc
              discovers the note and destroys it, worried about the
              consequences. To save Doc, Marty re-calibrates the DeLorean to
              return ten minutes before he left the future. The lightning
              strikes, sending Marty back to 1985, but the DeLorean breaks down,
              forcing Marty to run back to the mall parking lot. He arrives as
              Doc is being shot. While Marty grieves at his side, Doc sits up,
              revealing he pieced Marty's note back together and wore a
              bulletproof vest. He takes Marty home and departs to the future in
              the DeLorean.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marty wakes the next morning to discover his father is now a
              successful, confident author, his mother is fit and happy, his
              siblings have successful careers, and Biff is a servile valet in
              George's employ. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc suddenly
              reappears in the DeLorean, insisting they return with him to the
              future to save their children from terrible fates.

                  the McFlys, a family of Irish descent. Little is known about
                  Marty's life prior to the first Back to the Future film,
                  except for the fact that he set fire to the living-room rug
                  when he was 8 years old. He met his friend Dr. Emmett "Doc"
                  Brown when he was around fourteen after hearing that Brown was
                  a dangerous lunatic. Marty, being the “red-blooded American
                  teenager” h e was, wanted to go see what it was all about for
                  himself. He found Doc’s lab and was fascinated by all his
                  inventions. When Doc caught him, he was glad to have someone
                  who liked his work and their friendship started there.

                  Bio:<br />Doctor Emmett L. Brown refers to himself as "a
                  student of all sciences" and is depicted as a talented
                  inventor. Emmett's family moved to Hill Valley from Germany in
                  1908. Although initially wealthy because of his inheritance,
                  he spent his entire family fortune on his time travel project.
                  When the Brown mansion was destroyed by fire in 1962 and the
                  property sold to developers, Doc subsequently resided in the
                  mansion's garage. Once broke, he established a privately owned
                  business to offer 24-hour scientific services, building
                  ingenious devices for his customers.

                  Bio:<br />Doctor The character of Biff is developed with a
                  history that he was born in Hill Valley, California. He is
                  identified as the great-grandson of Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen,
                  son of Irving “Kid” Tannen. Rather than studying in high
                  school, he is depicted as preferring to bully George McFly
                  into doing his homework for him while he drinks and hangs out
                  with his friends. The only person at Hill Valley High school
                  that Biff is depicted as being afraid of, is Mr. Strickland.
                  Biff had been living with his grandmother, Gertrude Tannen, at
                  1809 Mason Street for some time by November 1955.
